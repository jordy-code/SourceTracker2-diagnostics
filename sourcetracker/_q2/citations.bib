  abstract = "Contamination is a critical issue in high-throughput metagenomic
              studies, yet progress toward a comprehensive solution has been
              limited. We present SourceTracker, a Bayesian approach to
              estimate the proportion of contaminants in a given community that
              come from possible source environments. We applied SourceTracker
              to microbial surveys from neonatal intensive care units (NICUs),
              offices and molecular biology laboratories, and provide a
              database of known contaminants for future testing.",
