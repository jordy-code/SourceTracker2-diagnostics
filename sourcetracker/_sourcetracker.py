    Summary
    -------
    Checks if data contains `nan` or `null` values, and returns data as
    type `np.int32`. If both `sources` and `sinks` are passed, columns must
    match exactly (including order).

    Parameters
    ----------
    sources : pd.DataFrame
        A dataframe containing count data. Must be castable to `np.int32`.
    sinks : optional, pd.DataFrame or None
        If not `None` a dataframe containing count data that is castable to
        `np.int32`.

    Returns
    -------
    pd.Dataframe(s)

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `nan` or `null` values found in inputs.
    ValueError
        If any values are smaller than 0.
    ValueError
        If any columns of an input dataframe are non-numeric.
    ValueError
        If `sources` and `sinks` passed and columns are not identical.

    Notes
    -----
    This function calls `validate_gibbs_input` before returning the collapsed
    source table to ensure aggregation has not introduced non-integer values.

    names. For instance, in the example below, .4 comes before 3.0 so the
    collapsed sources will have the 0th row as .4.

        Paramaters
        ----------
        alpha1 : float
            Prior counts of each feature in the training environments.
        alpha2 : float
            Prior counts of each feature in the Unknown environment. Higher
            values make the Unknown environment smoother and less prone to
            overfitting given a training sample.

        Attributes
        ----------
        m_xivs : np.array
            This is an exact copy of the source_data passed when the function
            is initialized. It is referenced as m_xivs because m_xiv is the
            [v, xi] entry of the source data. In other words, the count of the
            xith feature in the vth environment.
        m_vs : np.array
            The row sums of self.m_xivs. This is referenced as m_v in [1]_.
        V : int
            Number of environments (includes both known sources and the
            'unknown' source).
        tau : int
            Number of features.
        joint_probability : np.array
            The joint conditional distribution. Until the `precalculate` method
            is called, this will be uniformly zero.
        n : int
            Number of sequences in the sink.
        known_p_tv : np.array
            An array giving the precomputable parts of the probability of
            finding the xith taxon in the vth environment given the known
            sources, aka p_tv in the R implementation. Rows are (known)
            sources, columns are features, shape is (V-1, tau).
        denominator_p_v : float
            The denominator of the calculation for finding the probability of

            (source data).
        known_source_cp : np.array
            All precomputable portions of the conditional probability array.
            Dimensions are the same as self.known_p_tv.

        Notes
        -----
        This class exists to calculate the conditional probability given in
        reference [1]_ (with modifications based on communications with the
        author). Since the calculation of the conditional probability must
        occur during each pass of the Gibbs sampler, reducing the number of
        computations is of paramount importance. This class precomputes
        everything that is static throughout a run of the sampler to reduce the
        innermost for-loop computations.

        The formula used to calculate the conditional joint probability is
        described in the project readme file.

        The variables are named in the class, as well as its methods, in
        accordance with the variable names used in [1]_.

        Examples
        --------
        The class is written so that it will be created before being passed to
        the function which handles the loops of the Gibbs sampling.
        >>> cp = ConditionalProbability(alpha1 = .5, alpha2 = .001, beta = 10,
        ...                             np.array([[0, 0, 0, 100, 100, 100],
        ...                                      [100, 100, 100, 0, 0, 0]]))
        Once it is passed to the Gibbs sampling function, the number of
        sequences in the sink becomes known, and we can update the object with
        this information to allow final precomputation.
        >>> cp.set_n(367)
        >>> cp.precompute()
        Now we can compute the 'slice' of the conditional probability depending
        on the current state of the test sequences (the ones randomly assigned
        and then iteratively reassigned) and which feature (the slice) the
        sequence we have removed was from.
        >>> xi = 2
        Count of the training sequences (that are feature xi) currently
        assigned to the unknown environment.
        >>> m_xiV = 38
        Sum of the training sequences currently assigned to the unknown
        environment (over all features).
        >>> m_V = 158
        Counts of the test sequences in each environment at the current
        iteration of the sampler.
        >>> n_vnoti = np.array([10, 500, 6])
        Calculating the probability slice.
        >>> cp.calculate_cp_slice(xi, m_xiV, m_V, n_vnoti)
        array([8.55007781e-05, 4.38234238e-01, 9.92823532e-03])

    sink : np.array
        A one dimentional array containing counts of features whose sources are

    cp : ConditionalProbability object
        Instantiation of the class handling probability calculations.
    restarts : int

        Number of passes (withdrawal and reassignment of every sequence in the

    '''Gibb's sampling API.

    Notes
    -----
    This function exists to allow API calls to source/sink prediction and
    leave-one-out (LOO) source prediction.

    Input validation is done on the sources and sinks (if not None). They must
    be dataframes with integerial data (or castable to such). If both
    sources and sinks are provided, their columns must agree exactly.

    Input validation is done on the Gibb's parameters, to make sure they are
    numerically acceptable (all must be non-negative, some must be positive
    integers - see below).

    Warnings
    --------
    This function does _not_ perform rarefaction, the user should perform
    rarefaction prior to calling this function.

    This function does not collapse sources or sinks, it expects each row of
    the `sources` dataframe to represent a unique source, and each row of the
    `sinks` dataframe to represent a unique sink.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sources : DataFrame
        A dataframe containing source data (rows are sources, columns are
        features). The index must be the names of the sources.
    sinks : DataFrame or None
        A dataframe containing sink data (rows are sinks, columns are
        features). The index must be the names of the sinks. If `None`,
        leave-one-out (LOO) prediction will be done.
    alpha1 : float
        Prior counts of each feature in the training environments. Higher
        values decrease the trust in the training environments, and make
        the source environment distributions over taxa smoother. A value of
        0.001 indicates reasonably high trust in all source environments, even
        those with few training sequences. A more conservative value would be
        0.01.
    alpha2 : float
        Prior counts of each feature in the Unknown environment. Higher
        values make the Unknown environment smoother and less prone to
        overfitting given a training sample.
    beta : int
        Number of prior counts of test sequences from each feature in each
        environment.
    restarts : int
        Number of independent Markov chains to grow. `draws_per_restart` *
        `restarts` gives the number of samplings of the mixing proportions that
        will be generated.
    draws_per_restart : int
        Number of times to sample the state of the Markov chain for each
        independent chain grown.
    burnin : int
        Number of passes (withdarawal and reassignment of every sequence in the
        sink) that will be made before a sample (draw) will be taken. Higher
        values allow more convergence towards the true distribtion before draws
        are taken.
    delay : int >= 1
        Number passes between each sampling (draw) of the Markov chain. Once
        the burnin passes have been made, a sample will be taken, and
        additional samples will be drawn every `delay` number of passes. This
        is also known as 'thinning'. Thinning helps reduce the impact of
        correlation between adjacent states of the Markov chain.
    jobs : int
        The number of jobs to start. Typically not more than n-1 available
        processors
    create_feature_tables : boolean
        If `True` create a feature table for each sink. The feature table
        records the average count of each feature from each source for this
        sink. This option can consume large amounts of memory if there are many
        source, sinks, and features. If `False`, feature tables are not
        created.

    Returns
    -------
    mpm : DataFrame
        Mixing proportion means. A dataframe containing the mixing proportions
        (rows are sinks, columns are sources).
    mps : DataFrame
        Mixing proportion standard deviations. A dataframe containing the
        mixing proportions standard deviations (rows are sinks, columns are
        sources).
    fas : list
        ith item is a pd.DataFrame of the average feature assignments from each
        source for the ith sink (in the same order as rows of `mpm` and `mps`).

        ID's of the features.
    create_feature_tables : boolean
        If `True` create a feature table for each sink. The feature table
        records the average count of each feature from each source for this
        sink. This option can consume large amounts of memory if there are many
        source, sinks, and features. If `False`, feature tables are not
        created.
    loo : boolean
        If `True`, collate data based on the assumption that input data was
        generated by a `gibbs_loo` call.

    Notes
    -----
    This script is designed to be used by after completion of multiple
    `gibbs_sampler` calls (for different sinks). This function does _not_ check
    that the assumptions of ordering described below are met. It is the user's
    responsibility to check these if using this function independently.

    If `loo=False`, the order of the entries in each list (first 3 inputs) must
    be the same, and correspond to the order of the `sink_ids`.

    If `loo=True`, the order of the entries in each list (first 3 inputs) must
    be the same, and correspond to the order of the `source_ids`.
